	<h2>Fashion can seem superfulous and indulgent to an outsider (and probably to some insiders, too), but if you concentrate on a few designers that you like, they can introduce you to ideas and bring abstract ideas from architecture, geopolitics, and design to a personal level. I've been inspired by fashion for years and I've picked up some skills like sewing and flat pattern design along the way.</h2>

	<h2>My favorite designers are Raf Simons, Demna Gvasalia, and Martin Margiela.</h2>
